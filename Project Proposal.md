### Project 6 Proposal

#### Analysis Objective:
In this project I'm trying to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks to build a classifier for waste sorting. Since 2019, some tier 1 cities in China, such as Shanghai, published more strict trash sorting rules, in the meantime, it caused confusions among residents when sorting out household garbage. By building this classifier, I aim to help people correctly and more efficiently dispose waste.

#### Data Description:
The dataset I'll work with is an [image dataset](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip), which contain 2527 images:
* 501 glass
* 594 paper
* 403 cardboard
* 482 plastic
* 410 metal
* 137 trash

#### Tools:
* Python3

#### MVP Goal:
A pre-trained model with at least one additional trained layer
